## My process

- First step was to build the components and style each of them
    - Set html structure as model and then transfer the dynamic ones to jquery
    - Style components using tailwind
    - For the flip effect I used the following references:
    - [Create a card flip animation with css](https://vanslaars.io/articles/create-a-card-flip-animation-with-css)
    - [How to design a css card flip animation](https://dev.to/adetutu/how-to-design-a-css-card-flip-animation-creating-flipping-cards-on-hover-5ha6)
- After stylization, the next step was to build the page dynamically using jquery
  - set up time interval functions like countdown and timer
  - set up board function: handle game customization according to the game status
  - create functions to handle each game status
  - the final implementation was the _handleCardClick_ function, to handle all the outcomes of a user clicking on a card during game.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- jquery
